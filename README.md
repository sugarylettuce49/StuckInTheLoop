Everything in here is CC0
Basically you can do whatever you want with it.

Willhelm Scream sound effect has been removed, I don't know it's license since it's in a grey area.
The "Wilhelm Scream Remastered.wav" file, included in this source code, is not the actual Willhelm scream, and is actually some random scream I found that is CC0. (The ingame credits still show the old file tho)

If you want to add the actuall Willhelm Scream back and rerelease the game with it, here is the link where I got my specific version of the sound from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/el9n2v/free_to_use_the_wilhelm_scream_remastered/

It's totally safe to use, I just can't call it CC0 since it's status isn't really known.
